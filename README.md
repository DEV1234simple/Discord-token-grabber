# Discord-token-grabber
hello this is a new project of discord token grabber written in python 3 feel free to contribute and fork

Features:

No local caching
Transfers via Discord webhook
Searches for authorization tokens in multiple directories (Discord, Discord PTB, Discord Canary, Google chrome, Opera, Brave and Yandex)
No external Python modules required
[todo] Cross-platform support

How to use:

Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
Change the 'WEBHOOK_URL' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in token-grabber.py
(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)
Send the script to your victim and make them run it.
